/**
 * EZ_NETWORK  
 * Author: Joshua Maciak
 * Date: August 13 2017
 * 
 * EZ_NETWORK is a header full of various convenience functions
 * for networking. This header will contain a bunch of functions
 * that will take a lot of the leg-work out of communicating via 
 * sockets, which will mean less messy error-prone code in the EZ_RTP
 * library. It also provides a sense of module-ization. If later I need
 * to add something like packet-level encryption (DTLS) via OpenSSL,
 * I can simply switch out the implementations (in theory)
